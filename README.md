## What is Bash?

Bash is a cryptographic standard of Belarus released in 2016. The standardized 
algorithms follow the [Sponge-Based Crypto](https://keccak.team/files/CSF-0.1.pdf) 
paradigm and are based on the sponge function [`bash-f`](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/587.pdf). 
This function is actually a permutation over binary strings of length 1536. 

## What is this repo?

In this repo, we are discussing the forthcoming second edition of Bash.
